# Testing Hardware Circuits using Fault

Welcome to the fault tutorial. The sources for these files are hosted in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/leonardt/fault), please submit issues
using the GitHub issue tracker.  Pull requests with typo fixes and other
improvements are always welcome!

## Overview
* Abstract circuit testing in Python (integration with magma)
* Metaprogram tests (flexibility, parametrization, HW generators)
* Leverage Python libraries: pytest (also, constrained random number generators)
* Reuse (standard OOP)
* Simulation and formal (future plans: emulation and bringup)
* (plans) Coverage

## pytest Parametrization
### Exercise 2

## Assume/Guarantee
### Exercise 3

## Roadmap
