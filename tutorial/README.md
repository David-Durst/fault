# Testing Hardware Circuits using Fault

Welcome to the fault tutorial. The sources for these files are hosted in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/leonardt/fault), please submit issues
using the GitHub issue tracker.  Pull requests with typo fixes and other
improvements are always welcome!

## Overview
* Abstract circuit testing in Python (integration with magma)
* Metaprogram tests (flexibility, parametrization, HW generators)
* Leverage Python libraries: pytest (also, constrained random number generators)
* Reuse (standard OOP)
* Simulation and formal (future plans: emulation and bringup)
* (plans) Coverage

## Tester Abstraction
### Exercise 1

## pytest Parametrization
### Exercise 2

## Assume/Guarantee
### Exercise 3

# Fault Internals
This section provides an introduction to the internal architecture of the fault
system.  The goal is to provide the required knowledge for anyone interested in
contributing bug fixes, features, or refactors to the fault codebase.  The
fault API docs are hosted at
[http://truong.io/fault/](http://truong.io/fault/), this is a valuable link to
remember.


## Roadmap
### Simulation Actions
### Constrained Random
### Formal
